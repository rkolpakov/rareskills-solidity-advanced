### What problems ERC777 and ERC1363 solves?

`ERC777` and `ERC1363` both address a common issue with the limited functionality of the `ERC20` standard in Ethereum. Although `ERC20` is popular, it has a basic structure that doesn't support advanced direct interactions with smart contracts. This means that for certain actions, like automated payments or token interactions with contracts, additional steps and complex implementations are required.

`ERC777`'s main feature is hooks, allowing tokens to interact with smart contracts more dynamically. It lets contracts react when they receive tokens, making transactions like automated payments easier.

`ERC1363` makes `ERC20` tokens work like Ether in smart contracts: it combines token transfer and contract interaction in one step.

### Why was ERC1363 introduced?

According to [eip](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1363) the motivation is to make regular `ERC20` transfer more interactable. 

### What issues are there with ERC777?

Ethereum foundation has marked `ERC777` as [unsafe](https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-777) and suggests to use ERC20 instead due to its complexity and potential vulnerabilities.
